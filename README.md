### Automatic-Detection-of-COVID-19-Using-Chest-X-ray-Images-and-Deep-CNNs
COVID-19 Detection based on Chest X-rays and CT Scans using four Transfer Learning algorithms: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception. The models were trained for 500 epochs on around 1000 Chest X-rays and around 750 CT Scan images on Google Colab GPU. After training, the accuracies acheived for the model are as follows:
<pre>
                InceptionV3  VGG16   ResNet50   Xception
Chest X-rays    96%          94%      83%       92%

CT Scans        93%          93%      80%       95%
</pre>

# Dataset
In this study, chest X-ray images of 50 COVID-19 patients have been obtained from the open source GitHub repository shared by Dr. Joseph Cohen. This repository is consisting chest X-ray / CT images of mainly patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition, 50 normal chest X-ray images were selected from Kaggle repository called “Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)” . Our experiments have
been based on a created dataset with chest X-ray images of 50 normal and 50 COVID-19 patients (100 images in total). All images in this dataset were resized to 224x224 pixel size. In Figure 2 and Figure 3, representative chest X-ray images of normal and COVID-19 patients are given, respectively.

CT Scan images (750 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT/tree/master/Data-split
80% of the images were used for training the models and the remaining 20% for testing

# Theory
<b>ImageNet</b> is formally a project aimed at (manually) labeling and categorizing images into almost 22,000 separate object categories for the purpose of computer vision research.<br>
More information can be found <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/20/imagenet-vggnet-resnet-inception-xception-keras/">here</a>
<br>
<br>
<b>ResNet50</b> ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. Unlike traditional sequential network architectures such as AlexNet, OverFeat, and VGG, ResNet is instead a form of “exotic architecture” that relies on micro-architecture modules.<br>

<br>
<b>VGG16</b> is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. <br>

<b>Inception-V3</b> is a convolutional neural network that is 48 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 299-by-299.<br>
